# liri-node-app
Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. Text based SIRI clone with a few test features.

Liri accepts several arguments from the command line, including:

"my-tweets": Accesses twitter's API and gets the hardcoded user's latest tweets.  Up to 20.
"spotify-this-song": Does a spotify search for a song specified in the command line argument.  If no argument is presented, it defaults to Ace of Base, "The Sign"
"movie-this": Uses the OMDB API to search for a movie title specified in the command line argument.  If no argument is presented, it defaults to Mr. Nobody.
"do-what-it-says": Loads a command from a file called "random.txt" and runs it as an argument for Liri.

Screenshots: I've included three screenshots in this repo.  screenshot1.png shows Liri in action, performing a spotify search and screenshot2.png shows the "my-tweets" function in action.  Screenshot3.png shows the command line accepting an argument and searching for the movie "Krull," a wonderful, horrible film.
